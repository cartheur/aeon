The Aeon AGI

03.03.2023
	928: I have begun the full implementation of the aeon agi in this project, after several iterations working out the requisites of compass and embodiment as a piece of software that talks to 'as if it is intelligent' is - in reality - not. This document will serve as the background motif of how the architeture and runtime was implemented as I walked through the drawing sheets of my patent. This strategy will become clear as this project log progresses.
	1551: Some code will be used from older versions of aeon where it becomes required.
	1750: Today's work of implementation is complete and pushed to the repo.
