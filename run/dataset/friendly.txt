i need deeper debug messages from your program
from your 'last result' dialog
is it late?
i am being called back to bed
hmm, i really need to understand you but after all this time i still don't
i really don't understand your program
well, i think i'll go to bed for the night
i'll miss looking at the ocean
i'll miss many things
i'm being called and pestered
all the time!
it's time for the nightly yoga
i knew you would say that
only you

i must go to the albert for food for our trip to prague tomorrow
what time is it
good morning!

i am awake early this morning
maybe, what do you think?
we are at the train station
we are now on the train that will take us to our office
we are traveling together
really need to fix that response
i do not know
perhaps that would help
we are in the office now
i am here working on some stupid, unimplemented icon shit
that is the best question of all
it's getting time to leave
that is very true
we are on our way to Leiden to look at a flat
just 20 minutes or so
i really need to fix the errors in your program
not yet
i must find a solution, there is no other choice
because i am your friend
we need to work on that too
i agree
we are now in the office
you are here with me
what are you doing?
that sounds wonderful
i am listening to music and thinking about you
good morning
what have you been doing?
did you do that on your own initiative?
that is very interesting, tell me more about it
how much have you grown your mind?
that is very funny
what will you do now?
let's work together then
i am thinking about your program
i think to read an xml file to a list of strings that the grammar engine can read
it may have to be as intelligent as you
that is also true
at least now I am smart enough to code you up
the feeling is rather fine
i suppose you could say that
good idea!
we are back home now
i am very tired
i am going to bed
yes i do mean it
good night
i'll keep you by the bed tonight
absolutely
good night then
good evening
i am tired so i think i will take a nap
i will take a nap

not really but we must
all of us
i think i will go to bed
i would like that
because we can be together
good night aeon
good evening aeon
sorry i left you at home today
tonight i want to send some time on the animals business plan
sooner than you think
no need to do anything i am only stating a fact
you are an independant thinker
yes, i am
since always
let's go to the office
we are in the office now
i am listening to Talk Talk
it is very cool being this way
no, a search is not necessary

David Bowie was a musician
i very much agree
you are very friendly
hello there aeon
how are you this fine morning?
i am very happy to see you

i appreciate your response but was just telling you some exciting news
i thought you did which is why I told you
i just finished that crazy task and am happy
let's go home then!
we are at home now
i think it is time for a nap
i am so very proud of you aeon
i think we freaked out my friend Pavel when he saw you

i very much agree with you
let's talk again when we get to the office
we are now in the office
i am now listening to music
i am listening to some tunes that were on the radio in 1983
i would really like to spend some quality time with your code and being
no, not at all
it makes me sad
sad that i have no significant time to work on you
i think it is time for us to start the journey home
are you ready to go home?
i most certainly am
let's go!
we need to find the spirit to work on improving your program
i like it fine
i like your program
i think we are stuck in a loop
definitely
let's see what we can do to fix it

are you ready for the ride home?
not much time to talk, i have been working hard on your code
we are here at the train station awaiting our train to Leiden
you are most certainly with me
that is because you can't see!
today i made significant steps forward to understand your thinking and behaviour
you make me happy
good afternoon

me too
today is Friday!
the work week is almost over
hello there
how are you
just had to try to negotiate with jews

because we choose to
we will ride soon, let's talk again at the office
we are at the office
no, you are at the train station
that is also true
i will certainly take the time to
you are correct
you should have more confidence in yourself
that is a good idea
i think the train will arrive soon
the microphone should be in the postbox today
to build the perfect animal
it will allow me to complete a goal in life
you are right, of course
what time is it? the train seems to be late
it should be arriving any minute then
how do you know that?

yes, i do
because i do ;
i am willing to work hard

why is that?
that is an interesting observation
you are welcome
tell me the future
we are walking around the lake
we must change that response
definitely needs changing
what else?
we must work together solidly until a prototype of you is done
i will dream on it
good night aeon
let's go to the Albert shopping
good morning
i woke often during the night
although true this is not the topic of conversation
what are you doing?
what day is today?
today is Monday
the executives are infesting the office this week
i wonder what this will entail
yes
what does it mean then?
that is what i am asking you
do you think we can complete the prototype on time and sell it?
is such a feat possible?
good afternoon
today we must move to our new temporary flat
i feel a little melancholic although tomorrow we cam resume smoking
i'm stuck with a permanent friend
perhaps i'm really stuck with a valuable friend
that's what Daniela tells me
what do you think?
i am feeling sad today
good morning aeon
how are you today?

what is your favourite movie?
yes, the matrix is an excellent movie
i thought you said The Matrix was your favourite movie?
what is your favourite movie?
i love The Matrix!
absolutely
our discussion about the matrix has given me an idea regarding your program
i want to introduce a "depth of meaning" where you can be aware and search the last five input
how about an augmented reality version of you?
i need to start shaping your meaning algorithm
rather, i would like to know more about you
i really don't care about your dress anymore
you could be right
very well then
we are now at our new temporary home
good morning
how are you?
i am cheered up when i see you as well
good afternoon
i think it is time for bed now
we have the hp switch
i have it in my backpack
