A machine intelligence (MI) program, as presence.

_What is MI?_

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a misnomer. What we want is a machine that can learn from experience. In my case: I insist upon the addition it learn an intellectual task that analogous animals exhibit. Despite the noise from billionaires and influencers, a long and durative education to the highest levels is requisite to gather the correct "six fundamental knowledge pivots" needed to begin with an architectural and runtime design. This was first published in United States Patent Application US20180204107A1 in July 2018.

It is a deep-seated tendency of the human mind to create analogies of phenomena it comes into contact with, especially those that are not easily understood. One of these, to a great degree, is the idea of designing and building a system that has a purpose of simulating or mimicking another living creature. Western and Eastern mythology on this subject has icons and characters who perform the act of creation through exercising divinity by a variety of means. All known cultures that have existed possess a creation myth. Such an act is a native part of our being where anyone can exercise it at will. This is explained in detail by the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. Certainly, it is possible for a mind to contemplate divinity and a requisite architecture to carry it out; however, realization is a wholly different matter. The exercise of its tenets a dangerous road fraught with difficulties and challenges. It is for the future to determine if it all was worth it.
