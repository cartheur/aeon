An artificial general intelligence (AGI) program

## What is an AGI?

(From Wikipedia):

Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that human beings or other animals can.

## Why this AGI?

Despite the noise from billionaires and influencers, a long and durative education to the highest levels is requisite to gather the correct "six fundamental knowledge pivots" needed to begin with an architectural and runtime design. This was first published in United States Patent Application US20180204107A1 in July 2018.

As the marketing has ramped-up to ride the hype generated by ChatGPT, that it is some kind of AGI (it is not), this project is that very thing.

## Be patient

Although having been in existence for quite a few years, _this_ AGI is under development yet updated frequently.
